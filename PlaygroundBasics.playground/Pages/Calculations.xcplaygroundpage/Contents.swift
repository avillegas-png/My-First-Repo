//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:
3412 + 560 + 23

1000 - 999

1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10

10-7
//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
2*500

4*36
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
36/8

90/10
//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(100 + 50 + 900) / 2

(10+20+30)/
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
